My name is Huy Huynh and I'm currently seeking entry-level software development internships. I'm especially interested in all things computer vision and machine learning.

I'm a sophomore at the University of Washington majoring in computer science and engineering. Even though I've only completed a year at university, I've found a passion for machine learning and computer vision. I plan to pursue opportunities that expand on my curiosities and help me build the skills required to work on awesome projects involving neural networks and deep learning.

## What I'm Currently Learning 🌱
* CSE 312 Discrete Probability
* CSE 351 Hardware/Software Interface
* Machine Learning Specialization
* Neural Networks

## Projects 🔨
* ♟️Java Chess Engine: This project is a fully functioning chess engine implemented in Java. The engine uses a Mini-Max/Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to evaluate board states and determine the best move for each player.
