ðŸ‘‹Hi there! My name is Huy and I'm currently seeking entry-level software development internships. I'm especially interested in all things computer vision and machine learning.

I'm a rising sophomore at the University of Washington majoring in computer science and engineering. Even though I've only been in college for a year, I've found a passion for autonomous robots. I hope to pursue opportunities that expand on my curiosities and help me build the skills required to work on awesome projects like driverless vehicles.

## Skills and Experience
* ðŸ’» Java, Python, C, SQL
* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a chess engine in the Java programming language
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence
