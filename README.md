👋Hi there! My name is Huy and I'm currently seeking entry-level software development internships. I'm especially interested in all things computer vision and machine learning.

I'm a sophomore at the University of Washington majoring in computer science and engineering. Even though I've only completed a year at university, I've found a passion for machine learning and computer vision. I plan to pursue opportunities that expand on my curiosities and help me build the skills required to work on awesome projects involving neural networks and deep learning.

## Skills and Experience
* 💻 Java, Python, C, SQL
* 🔭 I’m currently working on a chess engine in the Java programming language
* 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence
